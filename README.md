## Approach

### 1. **Component-Based Design**

The app is built using **React components**, making it modular and easy to maintain. Key components include:

* **Header**: Displays app branding and navigation.
* **FilterSidebar**: Contains job filters like job type, location, and experience level.
* **JobListings**: Displays the list of jobs.
* **JobCard**: Shows each job in a card format.
* **JobDetail**: Shows detailed information when a job is clicked.

Each component is designed to handle its own functionality, ensuring the app stays organized.

### 2. **State Management with React Hooks**

The app uses **React hooks** to manage state and handle updates, making the code clean and efficient:

* **`useState`**: Keeps track of selected filters and job details.
* **`useMemo`**: Optimizes performance by memoizing filtered job results.
* **`useEffect`**: Loads data and updates the app when filters change.

This helps ensure the app is fast and responsive, even as the number of jobs grows.

### 3. **Filtering Jobs**

The app allows users to filter jobs by:

* **Job Type**: Full-time, part-time, contract, remote.
* **Location**: City or remote jobs.
* **Experience Level**: Entry, mid, or senior level.

The filtering system updates the job list based on the selected options, and only re-calculates when the filters change.

### 4. **Responsive Design**

**JobHub** is designed to work well on any device. On larger screens, the app shows a sidebar with filters, while on smaller screens, the layout stacks elements vertically for better readability and navigation.

### 5. **User-Friendly UI**

The app features a clean and simple design, with:

* **Job Cards**: Easy-to-read job listings with hover effects.
* **Filter Sidebar**: Allows users to quickly narrow down job listings.
* **Job Details**: Provides full job descriptions when a listing is clicked.

The goal is to make the app simple and intuitive for users to navigate.

### 6. **Future Features**

Some potential improvements for future versions:

* **User Accounts**: Save job preferences and apply directly through the app.
* **Pagination/Infinite Scroll**: Improve performance when there are many job listings.
